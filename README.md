## Problem Describtion
Body Condition Score is widely used for evaluating dairy cow's health status and milk production situation. Nowadays most of the BCS measurements are done by very experienced professionals, which require high cost of human resouces, time and money. In this repo, we used Microsoft Kinect v2 3D-cameras to take videos of dairy cows and made our datasets and applied several different models on them.
